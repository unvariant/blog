# TODOS

## change output file generation

Currently each input file will create an output file in `build/`, and directories generate a directory and an `index.html`.
Refactor the system to instead generate a directory for file or directories indiscriminately.

## add file info for binary files

checksec, readelf, etc

## add ability to target part of files in code blocks
