### spamming f keys

There is an easy cheese for UEFI challenges that immediately expose console access on boot. By spamming the `f10` key during the boot sequence of the EDK2 OVMF firmware boot sequence it will drop into the boot menu instead of the bootloader.

The byte sequence for the f keys can be found by stracing qemu:

```
$ sudo strace -e readv -p $(pgrep qemu)
strace: Process 1744629 attached
readv(0, [{iov_base="\33", iov_len=1}], 1) = 1
readv(0, [{iov_base="[", iov_len=1}], 1) = 1
readv(0, [{iov_base="2", iov_len=1}], 1) = 1
readv(0, [{iov_base="1", iov_len=1}], 1) = 1
readv(0, [{iov_base="~", iov_len=1}], 1) = 1
```

(What qemu reads when you type f10 in `-nographic` mode).

This can also be used to capture the sequences for the arrow keys.

One workaround for this cheese is to either patch out the code in OVMF which registers the f keys triggering the boot menu. The easier solution is to redirect serial to a unix socket instead of stdio, sleep long enough to pass the firmware boot, then use ncat to connect to the unix socket and allow communication.

### watchdog timer

Might be possible to simply wait for the watchdog timer to fire and kill the bootloader.

### exiting back to the uefi shell

If the challenge is run through a bootloader, returning from the bootloader or exiting will return back to the uefi shell.
