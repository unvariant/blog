## Program Interpreter

The program interpreter[^1] is declared in its own program header of type `PT_INTERP`. The then kernel[^2] uses the `p_offset` and `p_filesz` fields to extract the path of the program interpreter. Linux also enforces that the last byte of the program interpreter is null, otherwise it will refuse to load the binary.

## Dynamic Dependencies

The ELF spec states that programs that use dynamic linking must have a `PT_DYNAMIC`[^3] segment that corresponds to the `.dynamic` section (but the section doesn't _have_ to point to the same place[^4]). Any good ELF parser should completely ignore the `.dynamic` section and only trust the `PT_DYNAMIC` segment. The dynamic segment contains a list of dynamic tags that start at `p_vaddr`[^5] into the binary:

```c always
typedef struct {
	Elf32_Sword	d_tag;
   	union {
   		Elf32_Word	d_val;
   		Elf32_Addr	d_ptr;
	} d_un;
} Elf32_Dyn;

typedef struct {
	Elf64_Sxword	d_tag;
   	union {
   		Elf64_Xword	d_val;
   		Elf64_Addr	d_ptr;
	} d_un;
} Elf64_Dyn;
```

The list of dynamic tags are terminated by a `DT_NULL` entry, e.g. a dynamic tag with the tag set to `DT_NULL`. The dynamic segment is completely ignored by the kernel and only matters to the program linker. Each dynamic dependency that the binary needs are stored as `DT_NEEDED`[^6] entries and the dynamic tag value is used to lookup the name of the dependency in the binary. The dynamic segment also stores other important information for loading the binary: string table address, relocation table address, string table address, etc. You should always trust the values in the dynamic segment instead of section addresses when parsing a binary, because this is what the linker[^7] does as well.
