export const title = "Golfing Zig ELF Binaries";
export const description = "How small of a binary can we make zig generate?"

How much can we feasibly strip from a zig binary? Starting from a normal zig program that does absolutely nothing:

```rs title="main.zig" always
pub fn main() void {}
```

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-linux-gnu
du -hk main
# 2180    main
```

2180K for a binary that does nothing. Given that the smallest possible executable ELF file is around 80 bytes, 2180K is quite a bit of bloat. What happens when we strip out debug info?

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-linux-gnu -fstrip
du -hk main
# 192     main
```

Saved 1988K just by stripping out debugging information. However 192K is still quite far from our 80 byte goal. We are still compiling in Debug mode, so let's switch to ReleaseSmall (equivalent to -Os for gcc/clang as far as I can tell).

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-linux-gnu -fstrip -OReleaseSmall
du -hk main
# 12      main
```

Now we're at 12K! Saved 180K just by switching from Debug to ReleaseSmall. Next step is to enable function and data sections to allow the linker to strip away unreferenced functions or data.

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-linux-gnu -fstrip -OReleaseSmall -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections --gc-sections
du -hk main
# 12      main
```

...and that did nothing. I guess ReleaseSmall already handles this optimization.
Taking a peek at the ELF sections shows quite a few unnecessary sections:

`.eh_frame` and `.eh_frame_hdr` are generated to provide unwinding information, and is not strictly necessary for the the binary to run. The `.comment` section holds useless metadata. `.tbss` is a section for thread local storage, which is also unnecessary since the program does not do any threading.

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-freestanding-none -fstrip -OReleaseSmall
# warning(link): unexpected LLD stderr:
# ld.lld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; not setting start address
wc -c main
#      472 main
```

Switching from `x86_64-linux-gnu` to `x86_64-freestanding-none` cuts most of the extra cruft from the binary, down to 472 bytes. Looking at the sections now reveals that all but 2 sections have been removed:

But something isn't quite right. The binary no longer contains any executable code. This is because we have to change our executable's entrypoint. Now that our platform is freestanding, the entrypoint is `_start` instead of `main`.

```rs always
const syscall1 = @import("std").os.linux.syscall1;

export fn _start() void {
    _ = syscall1(.exit, 0);
}
```

Our compile command hasn't changed and the binary size is now slightly larger.

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-freestanding-none -fstrip -OReleaseSmall
wc -c main
#      616 main
```

Except now our binary has some executable code this time:

Looking at the size of the text section, it only contains 11 bytes of code. Where is the 605 extra bytes coming from? Inspecting the ELF further with readelf shows that there are 4 program segments. Each program segments takes up 56 bytes of space, for a total of $56 * 4 = 224$ bytes.

`GNU_STACK` is completely optional, and only acts as a hint to the linux kernel. `PHDR` is similarly unnecessary and the two `LOAD` segments can be merged into a single large RWX segment. We cannot directly control the program segments from the command line, so it is time to break out a linker script.

This script creates a single RWX segment that spans all of the executable code and data, cutting down the 4 segments to a single segment.

Recompiling with the linker script brings the binary down to `616 - 56 * 3 = 448` bytes.

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-freestanding-none -fstrip -OReleaseSmall -T linker.ld
wc -c main
#      448 main
```

We return our attention to the section headers in the binary. The linux kernel completely ignores section headers, so they can be safely removed without affecting the binary. The contents of `.comment` and `.shstrtab` can also be stripped since they are not mapped by any program segment.

Here we can take advantage of how the compiler lays out the ELF file.

```text always
ELF Header
Program segments
Section data (ALLOC)
Section data
Section headers
```

Sections that are marked as `ALLOC` are sections that are mapped by a program segment and required for program execution. The way the ELF file is created the Section headers and non alloc sections are all in one contiguous block at the end of the file. To strip out the extra metadata we can cut away any data that is after the last `ALLOC` section.

```py always
from pwnc.minelf import ELF

elf = ELF(open("main", "rb").read())

offset = 0
for section in elf.sections:
    if section.flags & elf.Section.Flags.ALLOC != 0:
        offset = section.offset + section.size

elf.header.section_offset = 0
elf.header.number_of_sections = 0
elf.header.section_name_table_index = 0
elf.raw_elf_bytes = elf.raw_elf_bytes[:offset]
elf.write("main")
```

Compiling and patching now yields a 131 byte binary. Much better.

```sh
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-freestanding-none -fstrip -OReleaseSmall -T linker.ld
python3 patch.py
wc -c main
#      131 main
```

Now we can apply some optimizations to the code in the binary to save a few bytes. The disassembled code shows that the function still attempts to return even though the program exits before, and a strange extra stub function at the end.

Marking the function as `noreturn` eliminates one of the extraneous `ret` instructions.

```rs always
const syscall1 = @import("std").os.linux.syscall1;

export fn _start() noreturn {
    _ = syscall1(.exit, 0);
    unreachable;

Switching from `syscall1` to `syscall0` eliminates `xor edi, edi`.

```rs always
const syscall0 = @import("std").os.linux.syscall0;

export fn _start() noreturn {
    _ = syscall0(.exit);
    unreachable;

`_start` is already marked as `noreturn`, so where is the `xor eax, eax ; ret` coming from? We can temporarily recompile with `-fno-strip` and dump the binary to figure out where the extra instructions are coming from.

What is `getauxval` doing here??? This is a freestanding environment so auxiliary values shouldn't be used at all. Since the function is not referenced by anything, adding the `-flto` compile option to strip out unused functions and data removes the extra code.

```sh always
zig build-exe main.zig -target x86_64-freestanding-none -fstrip -OReleaseSmall -T linker.ld -flto
python3 patch.py
wc -c main

This is the absolute limit that we can reach without using tricks to overlap the ELF metadata to further shrink the binary.

``` always
ELF Header        = 64 bytes
Program Header    = 56 bytes
Code              = 5 bytes
                  = 125 bytes
```

There is one last change that needs to be made before the binary can run on all linux systems. Currently the program header maps the binary at address `0x00000078`, which would require the linux kernel to map a page at address `0x00000000`.

```

Most linux distros set the sysctl value `vm.mmap_min_addr` to a non zero address to mitigate kernel exploits taking advantage of kernel NULL dereferences. This means that as the binary is right now, it will not run on most modern linux distros. To fix this we can update the python patching script to change the ELF file type from `EXEC` to `DYN`. This will tell the linux kernel to choose a base address for the binary instead of using the program segment addresses directly.

```py always
from pwnc.minelf import ELF

elf = ELF(open("main", "rb").read())
elf.header.type = elf.Header.Type.DYN

offset = 0
for section in elf.sections:
    if section.flags & elf.Section.Flags.ALLOC != 0:
        offset = section.offset + section.size

elf.header.section_offset = 0
elf.header.number_of_sections = 0
elf.header.section_name_table_index = 0
elf.raw_elf_bytes = elf.raw_elf_bytes[:offset]
elf.write("main")
```

The final ELF file:
