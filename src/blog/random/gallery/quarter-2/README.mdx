    My first detailed portrait, I am quite happy with how it turned out. The eyes and lips are where I applied the most attention to detail, and they look fairly realistic. I also captured the angle of the cheekbones and the shadow. The hat and jacket are much less detailed because they are less important.

    First low poly portrait, the hair is actually quite detailed but it is hard to tell because it is all dark colored. The face looks a bit strange because of how the lips turned out, but otherwise everything else is fine.

    Second low poly portrait, this one was a bit better and looks more similar to the original image than the first low poly portrait.  Again the hair is detailed but hard to see because of the dark color.

    The mountains were good on this one, but I struggled with the grass in the foreground and how to blend it properly into the middle ground. You can also tell I ran out of time because the right side is a flat gradient to blend from mud to grass.

    mainTitle={ <h2>Movie Posters</h2> }
    target="posters"
    columns={ 2 }
    optimize={ true }

<p>
    The first Inception poster I wanted the design to look like the city skyline is framing the title of the movie, but it was too simplistic. The rest are also very minimalist in design.

    target="logos"

    I was reading 1984 at the time, so I made a logo that looks like an eye staring at you with the words "War is peace, Ignorance is strength, Freedom is slavery" emblazoned on the eye. I also made logos designed around my team Les Amateurs.

    It was certainly interesting to learn about all the different facets of color theory, although I didn't really feel like I thought about it too much on the rest of the assignments.
