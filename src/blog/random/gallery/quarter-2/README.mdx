    My first detailed portrait, I am quite happy with how it turned out. The eyes and lips are where I applied the most attention to detail, and they look fairly realistic. I also captured the angle of the cheekbones and the shadow. The hat and jacket are much less detailed because they are less important.

    First low poly portrait, the hair is actually quite detailed but it is hard to tell because it is all dark colored. The face looks a bit strange because of how the lips turned out, but otherwise everything else is fine.

    Second low poly portrait, this one was a bit better and looks more similar to the original image than the first low poly portrait.  Again the hair is detailed but hard to see because of the dark color.
