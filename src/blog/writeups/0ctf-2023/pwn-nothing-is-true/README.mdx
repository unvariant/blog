# nothing is true

Seccomp rules that only allows `close`, `munmap`, `brk`, `exit`, `exit_group`, `mmap`, and `open` in 64 bit mode. There is an alternate set of rules for 32 bit mode, which allows `exit`, `read`, `write`, `brk`, `mmap`, `munmap`, and `exit_group`. Solution involves opening the flag in 64 bit mode, then switching to 32 bit to write the flag to stdout. The binary also checks for `syscall` and `int 0x80` instructions, but this can be easily bypassed with self modifying code.
