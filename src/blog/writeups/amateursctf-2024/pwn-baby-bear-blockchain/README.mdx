Don't you love it when people take perfectly functional rust projects and rewrite them in c?

## solution

Relies on a few bugs I found in the firedancer flamenco vm:
1. address checks can be bypassed using a negative length
2. out of bounds access of the registers array into the log buffer
3. out of bounds jump using the `CALL_REG` instruction

## unintendeds

Nobody solved using an unintended yay.
