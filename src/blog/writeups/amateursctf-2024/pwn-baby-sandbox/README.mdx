How many different ways are there to make a syscall?

`nc chal.amt.rs 1341`
</ChallengeInfo>

## solution

Use `sysenter` which is an alternate legacy method of performing a syscall. The biggest issue that most players ran into was not setting a proper `rbp` value, `sysenter` only completes successfully if `rbp` is set to a readable address along with the other arguments.

## unintendeds

### vector registers
I remembered to clear `fs` and `gs` registers this time but forgot to clear the vector registers...

### side channel
I was aware that my solution to `perfect-sandbox` from `amateursctf-2023` would also work on this challenge but I was too lazy to patch lol.

## issues

`sysenter` only works in 64 bit mode on intel processors, which caused some debugging issues for some players.
