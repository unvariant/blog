Turing complete relocations are fun and all, but you can use them to pop a shell?

`nc chal.amt.rs 1342`
</ChallengeInfo>

## solution

1. add `/proc/self/exe` as a dynamic dependency
    - allows the binary to be loaded at a relative offset to linker
2. use relocations to modify linker state to get rce

## unintended

none :D
