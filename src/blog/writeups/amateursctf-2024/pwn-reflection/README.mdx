Do you know what ret2dlresolve is?

</ChallengeInfo>

This challenge was ret2dlresolve without any gadgets to directly control `rdi`, which is needed to call `system("/bin/sh")`.
To prevent unintended cheeses any unnecessary function were replaced with `ret` instructions, reducing possible rop gadgets.

## solution

The intended solution abuses how `_dl_fixup` determines where to write the address of the resolved function. In most ret2dlresolve challenges, you do not care about where `_dl_fixup` writes the resolved symbol (as long as the address is writeable) because you are calling `system("/bin/sh")` to pop a shell immediately. However you can not do that directly in this challenge without `rdi` control.

```c open
_dl_fixup (
# ifdef ELF_MACHINE_RUNTIME_FIXUP_ARGS
	   ELF_MACHINE_RUNTIME_FIXUP_ARGS,
# endif
	   struct link_map *l, ElfW(Word) reloc_arg)
{
  const ElfW(Sym) *const symtab
    = (const void *) D_PTR (l, l_info[DT_SYMTAB]);
  const char *strtab = (const void *) D_PTR (l, l_info[DT_STRTAB]);

  const uintptr_t pltgot = (uintptr_t) D_PTR (l, l_info[DT_PLTGOT]);

  const PLTREL *const reloc
    = (const void *) (D_PTR (l, l_info[DT_JMPREL])
		      + reloc_offset (pltgot, reloc_arg));
  const ElfW(Sym) *sym = &symtab[ELFW(R_SYM) (reloc->r_info)];
  const ElfW(Sym) *refsym = sym;
  void *const rel_addr = (void *)(l->l_addr + reloc->r_offset);
  lookup_t result;
  DL_FIXUP_VALUE_TYPE value;

  /* --- snip --- */

  return elf_machine_fixup_plt (l, result, refsym, sym, reloc, rel_addr, value);
}

static inline ElfW(Addr)
elf_machine_fixup_plt (struct link_map *map, lookup_t t,
		       const ElfW(Sym) *refsym, const ElfW(Sym) *sym,
		       const ElfW(Rela) *reloc,
		       ElfW(Addr) *reloc_addr, ElfW(Addr) value)
{
  return *reloc_addr = value;
}
```

This is the source code for `_dl_fixup` which is used in ret2dlresolve. The location that the resolved symbol is written back to is blindly trusted from `reloc->r_offset`, which we control. What happens if we setup `reloc->r_offset` to point to the `gets` got table entry ðŸ¤”. Once the ret2dlresolve payload is invoked `system` is called and does not crash as long as it points to readable memory, and `gets` now points to `system` instead! Now we can return to main and call `system` with controlled `rdi` argument by abusing the same code that calculates the first argument that is passed into `gets`.

## unintended

Turns out that after a `gets` call `rdi` points into the libc... which is exploitable... ðŸ˜­.
