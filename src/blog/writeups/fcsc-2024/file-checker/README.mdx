# file-checker

This was a really interesting challenge from `fcsc-2024` that had a total of two solves by the end of the ctf. I did not solve the challenge during the ctf, but after the ctf I was talking to one of the solvers `@skuuk` about an alternate solution.

## my solution abusing ifunc symbol resolution

`FCSC{93aa742b341b591bb4a6cad5c1b9c63ba382ec6f8dd373ca82fd7c777443fe44}`

Below are the writeups from the people who solved during the ctf, I highly recommend reading them as well.
