# ding-o-tron

Greeted with a page that tells us to click a button 9000 times...

```js open
setInterval(() => window.ding(), [4]);
```
Surely the challenge is not that easy right?

```text open
[ERROR] You're dinging too quickly!
```
...aaand it yells at you for dinging too quickly. :/

Digging a bit deeper it turns out the main logic is handled inside a wasm program. Since the wasm has to interact
with external js in order to determine the current time, we can hijack those syscalls to trick the wasm into thinking
more time has passed and bypassing the dinging too quickly error.

```js filename="hijack.js" open
window.go = go;
const setInt64 = (addr, v) => {
	window.go.mem.setUint32(addr + 0, v, true);
	window.go.mem.setUint32(addr + 4, Math.floor(v / 4294967296), true);
}
window.seconds = 0;
go.importObject.go["runtime.nanotime1"] = (sp) => {
  sp >>>= 0;
	setInt64(sp + 8, window.seconds * 1e9);
	window.seconds += 1;
}
window._seconds = 0;
go.importObject.go["runtime.walltime"] = (sp) => {
	sp >>>= 0;
	setInt64(sp + 8, window._seconds);
	window.go.mem.setInt32(sp + 16, 0, true);
	window._seconds += 1;
}
playSound = () => {};
yay = () => {};
updateCount = console.log;
```

A few minutes later we are greeted with another error:
```text open
[LOL] Did you think it would be that easy? Can you find my secret hidden function?
```

Looks like the 9000 clicks was a red herring :(.

```js filename="download.js" open
var blob = new Blob([new Uint8Array(window.go.mem.buffer)]),
    e    = document.createEvent('MouseEvents'),
    a    = document.createElement('a')

a.download = "mem.bin"
a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
a.dataset.downloadurl =  ['text/plain', a.download, a.href].join(':')
e.initMouseEvent('click', true, false, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false, false, false, false, 0, null)
a.dispatchEvent(e)
```

With wasm challenges you can sometimes cheese them by looking through wasm memory for flags or interesting strings,
and since the wasm heap is a js Uint8Array we can download it directly and inspect it.

```js path="strings.txt" range="488," open
```

That is a suspicious function name... what happens when we run it in the console?

The challenge finally spits out the flag :).
